        <h1>Neuralink</h1>
        <hr>
        <img src="./images/techtalk/Neuralink(2).jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Relationship psychologists have shown that peopleâ€™s trust in artificial intelligence (AI) is tied to their relationship or attachment style. As progress in traditional computing slows, new forms of computing are coming to the forefront. A team of engineers are attempting to pioneer a type of computing that mimics the efficiency of the brainâ€™s neural networks while exploiting the brainâ€™s analog nature.Scientists have discovered a new way to connect human brains to computers - through veins.

        <h3>WHAT IS NEURALINK?</h3>
        <p>Neuralink is a device that will be surgically implanted into your brain and with it, youâ€™ll be able to communicate with machines and even control them. It will also help study the electrical signals in the brain and arrive at solutions that can help cure various medical problems. With Neuralink a chipset, called N1 chipset, will be installed in your skull which is 8mm in diameter and has multiple wires housing electrodes and insulation for the wires.</p>
        <img src="./images/techtalk/Neuralink(3).jpeg" alt="">
        <h3>HOW DOES NEURALINK WORK?</h3>
        <p>Your brain sends information to different parts of your body using neurons. These neurons in your brain connect with each other to form a large network and communicate using chemical signals called neurotransmitters. This reaction generates an electric field and you can record these reactions by placing electrodes nearby.</p>
        <h3>HOW IS NEURALINK INSTALLED?</h3>
        <p>Neuralink will be using its specially developed robots to carry out the quick and precise insertion of the device into the cortex. The Neuralink robot will insert the module into your brain using a microscope and needles the size of 24 microns (a micron is one-millionth of a meter). These needles are so small that you canâ€™t easily spot them with the naked eye. The operation will require a 2mm incision which will be dilated up to 8mm. After the procedure is complete the exposed part of the skull will be covered with the chipset module. The installation procedure could take up to two hours according to Musk and the person could also be under partial anaesthesia during the process.</p>
        <h3>ADVANTAGES</h3>
        <p>- The machine will be able to help paraplegics with simple tasks like operating a phone or interacting with a computer. It may also be used to treat epilepsy. <br>
            - The device will also be able to help regain someoneâ€™s eyesight even if they have lost their optic nerve. <br>
            - Neuralink can also be used to restore memory, speech and movement of a paralysed person. <br>
            - It will also be able to help humans interact with each other without the need to actually talk.</p>
        <h3>DISADVANTAGES</h3>
        <p>- If the device is connected to the internet how will we be protected against hackers who might try to steal data directly from our brains. <br>
            - Some unknown long-term impact on the brain from decomposition by the body of the electrode materials over time. <br>
            - Chip has the potential to decrease the work of the biological version of brain.</p>
        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>The Neuralink project, if implemented successfully, would indeed change many things around us and it will boost the area of research and technology. Certain research and development take decades or even centuries to complete, so the knowledge and efforts of a scientist can be preserved and used further in his absence. At the same time, it is not an easy task to replicate the convoluted brain system into a computer chip. It may take several years to decades to accomplish this.</p>
