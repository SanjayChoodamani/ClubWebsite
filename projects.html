            <p>The Malnad Technical Club dawned with the concept of serving as a hub
                for tech enthusiasts to explore their innovative ideas and projects.
                Every year, the club members are divided into teams and develop projects
                to have a better comprehension of new age technology which helps cater
                to the needs of the current generation. It also encourages teamwork and

                <p>An accelerometer-based robot using Arduino that uses hand gestures for navigation. It has military,
                    industrial and domestic applications.Different gestures actuate different movements and hence the
                    robot can be easily controlled.</p>

                <p>It is a bluetooth based robot that can be controlled by a simple mobile application. It is programmed
                    using Nodemcu microcontroller and the robot's movement is controlled using a mobile application
                    which is a virtual joystick. It can be of great use in remote surveillance, military applications,
                    home automation and other diverse fields.</p>

                <h2>Automated unmanned railway level crossing system</h2>
                <p>It is an Arduino based project which mainly deals with automatic railway gate operation. The ultimate
                    goal of the automatic railway gate operation is to replace gates operated by man(gatekeepers)at a
                    level crossing to an automated unmanned level crossing system. The project mostly has to do it with
                    two things, firstly it deals with the reduction of time for which the gate is being kept closed and
                    secondly it contributes to the safety of the road users by reducing accidents.</p>

                <p>The self-balancing robot is similar to an upside down pendulum. Similar is the case with a
                    self-balancing robot, only that the robot will fall either forward or backward.Just like how we
                    balance a stick on our finger, we balance the robot by driving its wheels in the direction in which
                    it is falling. What we are trying to do here is to keep the center of gravity of the robot exactly
                    above the pivot point.</p>

                    power supply on robot is turned on, the robot starts following the line. This robot utilizes a array
                    of infrared transmitters and receivers. Simple line follower robot can be built without

                    mobile application. It facilitates and simplifies human work. We are placing a motor at the front of
                    the robot, the motor is attached with the sharp blade for grass cutting. The robot wheel movement
